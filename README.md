# CodeAlpha Credit Scoring Model 💳

Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**.
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts an individual's creditworthiness based on their financial and personal data.

The model helps classify whether a customer is a **good credit risk** or a **bad credit risk** using historical financial information.

---
 Objective

* To preprocess financial dataset
* To build a classification model
* To evaluate model performance using accuracy and other metrics

---

 Dataset Used

**Dataset Name:** German Credit Dataset

The dataset contains information such as:

* Age
* Job
* Housing
* Credit amount
* Duration
* Saving accounts
* Checking accounts
* Purpose of loan

The last column represents the **credit risk category**.

 Technologies & Libraries Used

### Programming Language

* Python

### Libraries

* Pandas → Data handling
* NumPy → Numerical operations
* Scikit-learn → Machine learning algorithms
* Matplotlib → Data visualization

 Machine Learning Algorithm Used

**Random Forest Classifier**

This algorithm was chosen because:

* It provides high accuracy
* Handles categorical data well
* Reduces overfitting

---

 Steps Performed in the Project

1. Imported dataset
2. Cleaned and preprocessed data
3. Converted categorical values into numerical format
4. Split dataset into training and testing sets
5. Trained Random Forest model
6. Evaluated model performance

Model Performance

The model achieved good accuracy in predicting credit risk.

Evaluation metrics used:

* Accuracy Score
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
